## Blendish and OUI

For generating themes, Wima uses a modified version of
[Blendish](https://bitbucket.org/duangle/oui-blendish/src) (contained in the
[`src/bnd`](src/bnd) directory), a Blender 2.5 UI-based theming library for
[NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg). Wima also uses a modified version
of [OUI](https://bitbucket.org/duangle/oui-blendish/src) (contained in the
[`src/oui`](src/oui) directory), otherwise known as OpenUI, for layout. OUI is
pronounced like the French word for "yes." The original code for Blendish and
OUI is subject to the following copyright:

> Copyright &copy; 2014 Leonard Ritter (<leonard.ritter@duangle.com>).

Modifications to Blendish and OUI are licensed under a

## NanoVG

Wima uses a modified version of [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg)
(contained in the [`src/nanovg`](src/nanovg) directory), a library for drawing
vector graphics with OpenGL. The original code for NanoVG is subject to the
following copyright:

> Copyright &copy; 2013 Mikko Mononen (<memon@inside.org>).

The modifications to NanoVG were not written by Project LFyre, so they are
subject to the following copyright:

> Copyright &copy; 2016 Michael Wynne (<https://github.com/MikeWW>).

Both the original code and modifications are under the following license:
