## Blendish and OUI

For generating themes, Wima uses a modified version of
[Blendish](https://bitbucket.org/duangle/oui-blendish/src) (contained in the
[`src/theme`](src/theme) directory), a Blender 2.5 UI-based theming library for
[NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg). Wima also uses a modified version
of [OUI](https://bitbucket.org/duangle/oui-blendish/src) (contained in the
[`src/ui`](src/ui) directory), otherwise known as OpenUI, for layout. OUI is
pronounced like the French word for "yes." The file
[`src/tests/bnd_oui_demo.c`](src/tests/bnd_oui_demo.c) is also originally part
of Blendish/OUI, and there is some code in the [`src/math`](src/math) directory
that was also part of Blendish/OUI.

The original code for Blendish and OUI is subject to the following copyright:
